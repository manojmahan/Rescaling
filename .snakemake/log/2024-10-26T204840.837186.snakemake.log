MissingOutputException in rule plot in file /home/mkmahan/Rescaling/main.smk, line 28:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
subsample/query_files_subsample_to_reference_files_ewp_1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
