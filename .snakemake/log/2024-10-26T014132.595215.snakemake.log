MissingOutputException in rule get_frequency in file /home/mkmahan/Rescaling/main.smk, line 12:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
freq/query_files.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
